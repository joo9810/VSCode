Background

So, if you're a musician in Korea, you should start with 'ppong', but no one was doing it, so I started it naturally." about the reason for making the album.[3] He released a documentary about the album's production process Finding Ppong (뽕을 찾아서), and cameo featured Han Sangcheol of Bulssazo, saxophonist Lee Jeongsik and keyboardist Kim Sooil.[4]
