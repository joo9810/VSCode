The Vancouver Sun wrote that "the star of this show is Arnold's straight-ahead harp playing in a style inspired by Sonny Boy Williamson... The sound he wrenches from the instrument—raunchy distortion with a touch of reverb—just about defines Chicago blues."[15] The Washington Post said that Arnold and his band "forego the stomp rhythms of Muddy Waters and Willie Dixon for a bluesy, greasy swing that's pure pleasure."[11] The Chicago Tribune concluded that "Arnold's vocal range throughout Eldorado Cadillac is undeniably deeper and fuller than it was in 1956, but his outlook is happily the same."[13]

The Times Colonist determined that "Arnold uses adept vocal phrasing to add a dramatic edge to his narrow range, and his blues harp is a haunting, riveting, delicious treat."[17] The Los Angeles Times deemed Eldorado Cadillac "a solid, sweaty blues collection."[18] The Santa Cruz Sentinel praised Arnold's "distorted harmonica and cool singing."[19]

AllMusic called the album "a fun set of passionate Chicago blues."[3]
