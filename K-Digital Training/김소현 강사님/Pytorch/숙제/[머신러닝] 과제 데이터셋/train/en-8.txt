Imago Relationship Therapy (IRT) is a form of therapy that focuses on relationship counseling.[1]

IRT was developed by Harville Hendrix and Helen LaKelly Hunt.[1] The word imago is Latin for "image"; in this sense, it refers to the "unconscious image of similar love", according to one therapist.[2]

A 2017 study of the method's effectiveness found that couples participating in IRT increased marital satisfaction during treatment (and to a lesser extent at a follow-up) but that the improvements were not clinically significant.[3]
